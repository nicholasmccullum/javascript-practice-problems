//Before starting these practice problems, you will want to connect your index.html file to this JavaScript file.
//To do this, change the script tag so that it links to 'starter-files/04-booleans.js' instead of 'script.js'.

// Question 1
//Create boolean variables called trueBoolean and falseBoolean and assign them values of true and false, respectively.
//For the reasons discussed in the course, be sure to uset he let keyword.

let trueBoolean = true;
let falseBoolean = false;

//Question 2
//Using the var1 and var2 variables declared below, 
//log a boolean value to the console that indicates whether var1 is greater than var2.

const var1 =  5;
const var2 = 10;

//Solution goes here

console.log(var1 > var2);

//Question 3
//Log a boolean value to the console that indicates whether var1 is less than var2.

console.log(var1 < var2);

//Question 4
//Log a boolean value to the console that indicates whether var1 is greater than or equal to var2.

console.log(var1 >= var2);

//Question 5
//Log a boolean value to the console that indicates whether var1 is less or equal to var2.

console.log(var1 <= var2);

//Question 6
//Given the language variable declared below, 
//log a boolean value to the console that tests whether this language is equal to "Python"

const language = 'JavaScript';

//Solution goes here

console.log(language === 'Python')
