//Before starting these practice problems, you will want to connect your index.html file to this JavaScript file.
//To do this, change the script tag so that it links to 'starter-files/12-filer-find.js' instead of 'script.js'.

//Question 1
//Use the JavaScript filter function to return an array whose elements 
//are all the elements of numberArray that are greater than 6.
//Log this new array to the console.

numberArray = [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 4, 6, 8, 5, 1, 6, 4, 7, 9, 6]

//Solution goes here



//Question 2
//In the lesson associated with these practice problems, we saw the following array:

const journal = [

    {events: ["work", "touched tree", "pizza",
  
              "running", "television"],
  
     squirrel: false},
  
    {events: ["work", "ice cream", "cauliflower",
  
              "lasagna", "touched tree", "brushed teeth"],
  
     squirrel: false},
  
    {events: ["weekend", "cycling", "break", "peanuts",
  
              "beer"],
  
     squirrel: true},
  
  ];

//Use the find method to return the first day where the author did not encounter a squirrel.
//Log this journal entry to the console.
