//Before starting these practice problems, you will want to connect your index.html file to this JavaScript file.
//To do this, change the script tag so that it links to 'starter-files/07-objects.js' instead of 'script.js'.

//Question 1

const int2 = 5;

//Solution goes here

//Question 5
// Write an if statement with an else if and else clause.
//If the variable int4 is equal to 2, it should log "The variable is equal to 2" to the console.
//If the variable int4 is equal to 7, it should log "The variable is equal to 7" to the console.
//Otherwise, the script should log "The variable is not equal to 2 or 7" to the console.

const int4 = 5;

//Solution goes here



//Question 6
//Write a function called nameClassifer.
//It should accept one argument, name.
