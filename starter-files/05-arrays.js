// Question 1
//Create a JavaScript arrays that contains two elements. 
//The elements should be your first and last name.

//Access the last item of the following JavaScript array and log it to the console.

longArray = [1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 9, 7, 5, 3, 4, 7, 9, 6, 1, 5, 8];

//Solution goes here

const multiplesOfTen = [20, 30, 40, 50];

//Solution goes here

const numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

//Solution goes here:




//Question 8
//Use the slice method to select mushrooms and onions from the following array.
//Assign these two items to a new array called someIngredients.

const allIngredients = ['pepperoni', 'sauce', 'flour', 'mushrooms', 'onions', 'green peppers', 'cheese'];

//Solution goes here




//Question 9
//What is the main difference between the slice and splice methods?



//Question 10
//Use the spread operator combined with the slice method to add'PEI' between 'Nova Scotia' and 'New Brunswick'.
//Assign the new array to a variable called maritimeProvinces.
//Log this array to the console.

const someProvinces = ['Nova Scotia', 'New Brunswick'];

//Solution goes here



//Question 11

//Log the new array to the console.

const allHydrocarbons = ['methane', 'ethane', 'propane', 'butane', 'pentane', 'hexane', 'heptane', 'octane', 'nonane', 'decane'];
